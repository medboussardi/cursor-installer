A robust installation script for the AI-powered [Cursor Editor](https://cursor.sh) on Linux systems. This script automates the process of installing Cursor from the AppImage format to a fully integrated system application.

## üöÄ Features

- **System-wide installation**: Properly installs Cursor for all users
- **Desktop integration**: Adds application menu entry and enables taskbar pinning
- **Terminal access**: Run Cursor from any terminal with the simple `cursor` command
- **Proper icon setup**: Extracts and installs the Cursor icon system-wide
- **Mime type association**: Associate text files with Cursor
- **Clean installation**: Follows Linux standards for application installation

## üìã Prerequisites

- A Linux distribution (tested on Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, and Arch-based systems)
- `sudo` privileges
- The Cursor AppImage file (download from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh))

## üíª Installation

### Option 1: Quick Install

1. Download the Cursor AppImage from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. Download the installation script
3. Make the script executable and run it with sudo:

```bash
chmod +x setup-cursor.sh
sudo ./setup-cursor.sh
```

### Option 2: Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-installer.git
cd cursor-installer
# Place the Cursor AppImage in this directory
chmod +x setup-cursor.sh
sudo ./setup-cursor.sh
```

## üõ†Ô∏è What the Script Does

This script performs the following actions:

1. Verifies the Cursor AppImage exists and makes it executable
2. Creates necessary directories in system locations
3. Copies the AppImage to `/opt/cursor/`
4. Extracts the application icon
5. Creates a wrapper script for terminal usage
6. Adds a proper desktop entry file for application menus
7. Updates system caches for immediate availability

## üìù Common Issues and Solutions

### Cannot Find Cursor in Application Menu

If Cursor doesn't immediately appear in your application menu after installation:

```bash
# Refresh the desktop database manually
sudo update-desktop-database
```

Or log out and log back in to refresh your desktop environment.

### Cannot Pin to Taskbar

This is usually due to incorrect `StartupWMClass` in the desktop entry. Our script sets this correctly, but if you're still having issues:

```bash
# Verify the desktop entry
cat /usr/share/applications/cursor.desktop
```

The `StartupWMClass` should be set to `Cursor`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

You can modify the script to change installation paths or other parameters. The main configurable sections are:

- Installation directory (default: `/opt/cursor/`)
- Icon locations
- Desktop entry properties
